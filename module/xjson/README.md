xjson
================================

> JSON helper utilities for Go, intended as a small aggregator for CLI and debugging.

&nbsp;

This package aims to collect reusable JSON manipulation helpers in one place. At
the moment it only exposes a debug-oriented `Dump` function, but it is intended to
grow into a broader collection of JSON utilities.

## PURPOSE

`xjson` is designed to centralize JSON helper functions for command-line and utility
code. The package currently focuses on debug serialization and readable JSON output,
with the future goal of aggregating additional JSON manipulation utilities.

## INSTALLATION

Use `go get` to add the package:

```shell
  go get github.com/AeonDigital/Go-Core/xjson@latest
```

Import it in your code:

```go
import "github.com/AeonDigital/Go-Core/xjson"
```

________________________________________________________________________________

## BASIC USAGE

Serialize a value to an indented JSON string for debugging:

```go
output := xjson.Dump(myValue, "")
fmt.Println(output)
```

If the indentation string is empty, `Dump` defaults to two spaces.

```go
output := xjson.Dump(myValue, "    ")
```

If marshaling fails, `Dump` returns a string containing the error message, which
makes it safe for debug prints.

## SUPPORTED APIS

Currently the package exposes:

- `xjson.Dump(v any, i string) string`

This function is intended to provide a single consistent JSON dump helper while the
package expands into a broader JSON utility collection.

## EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES

`xjson` depends only on the Go standard library:

- `encoding/json`

No third-party packages are required.
